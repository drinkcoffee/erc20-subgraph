# All ERC20s Subgraph 

This code is inspired by similar projects [1](https://github.com/georgeroman/erc20-subgraph)[2](https://github.com/Abidoyesimze/subgraph). It processes all ERC20 contracts on a chain, only looking at transfers, thus only holding balances. The dependencies have been updated relative to the other projects.
